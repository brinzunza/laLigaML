# Premier League Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on using machine learning to predict outcomes of Premier League football matches. The project uses historical match data, applying various machine learning algorithms to predict whether the home team will win, lose, or draw. This project is mostly part of the Dataquest platform’s machine learning project. 

## Project Overview

	•	Data preprocessing (cleaning, filling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
	•	Feature engineering to extract useful match statistics
	•	Training a machine learning model to predict match outcomes
	•	Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix

## Data

The dataset includes historical match results from the Premier League, with columns representing:

	•	Match date
	•	Home and away teams
	•	Home and away goals
	•	Various match statistics (shots, possession, fouls, etc.)
	•	The final result (win, lose, or draw for the home team)
